Build a new file () with the results of fstrValue at the top
	/*First lines of file */
	SELECT	0 as flngOrder, '[fstrEnvironment]' AS fstrValue
	UNION ALL SELECT 1 as flngOrder ,'fstrLogical=fstrPhysical' AS fstrValue
	UNION ALL SELECT 2 as flngOrder, 'BaseEnv=' + LEFT(db_Name(),2) AS fstrValue
	ORDER BY flngOrder


Then under that

Below is a query that builds a set of queries that will give the final results that will need to be appended to the same file under the above results.
Run the following on the [System] database on each major server (D/T,S,P), then paste those results of column fstrValue under the results from above.

	SELECT  
			'UNION ALL 

	SELECT ' + CAST(row_number() OVER (ORDER BY (Select 1)) as varchar(MAX)) + ' AS flngOrder1, 0 as flngOrder2, ''[' + fstrEnvironment + ']'' AS fstrValue

	UNION ALL

	SELECT '  + CAST(row_number() OVER (ORDER BY (Select 1)) as varchar(MAX)) + ' AS flngOrder1, 1 as flngOrder2, fstrLogical + ''='' + fstrServer + ''|'' + fstrPhysical
	FROM	' + 'dbo.tblDatabase
	WHERE	fstrEnvironment = ''' + fstrEnvironment + '''

	'
				
	FROM (
			SELECT 	fstrEnvironment
			FROM	tblDatabase
			GROUP BY fstrEnvironment
	) AS Env(fstrEnvironment)

;Todo:
This can create duplicates...we should do something to remove them
