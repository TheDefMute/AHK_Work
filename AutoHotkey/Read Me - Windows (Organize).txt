Windows (Organzie).ini will need to be filled out
This also has some base programs used by "Programs-Generic"
-Notepad++
-Sticky Notes
-One Note


Structure of "Windows (Organzie).ini" file:
[ProgramRun_Base]
List of applications that you want to open when hitting Alt+Shift+F1
Example: Title=Path to run application

[ProgramRun]
List of apps that you want to open, defined in Programs-Generic.ahk. Currently just has a few defined.
Example: Title=Path to run application

[Monitors_Any]
[Monitors_1]
[Monitors_2]
[Monitors_3]
These are list of Sections named for applications that we want to organize depending on how many monitors are setup.
Title of the item does not matter. 
example: Title={[Section name]} ie Application1=OneNote_MonitorCount_2


[{SOME APP NAME}_MonitorCount_2]
Under one of the above areas (MonitorX), you would have the following Items

PosX= X location where to place the application
PosY= Y location where to place the application
Width= Width of the application
Height= Height of the application
WinMax= 0/1 should the window be maximized. If this is true, Width/height can be blank
